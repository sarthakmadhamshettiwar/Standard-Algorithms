Corrections and Detailed Explanation:

1. LPS Array Correction:
   - The correct LPS array is `[0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

2. Example Walkthrough:
   Let's break down how the LPS array is computed for "AABAACAABAA":
   - Index 0: 'A' - No previous match, so lps[0] = 0
   - Index 1: 'A' - Matches previous 'A', so lps[1] = 1
   - Index 2: 'B' - No match, so lps[2] = 0
   - Index 3: 'A' - Matches first character, so lps[3] = 1
   - Index 4: 'A' - Continues the match, so lps[4] = 2
   - Index 5: 'C' - No match, so lps[5] = 0
   - Index 6: 'A' - Matches first character, so lps[6] = 1
   - Index 7: 'A' - Continues match, so lps[7] = 2
   - Index 8: 'B' - New character, but matches part of the pattern, so lps[8] = 3
   - Index 9: 'A' - Continues match, so lps[9] = 4
   - Index 10: 'A' - Continues match, so lps[10] = 5

3. Key Observations (Corrected):
   - Fallback mechanism works by using previously computed LPS values
   - When a mismatch occurs, the algorithm doesn't start from the beginning but uses the previously matched prefix length
   - This approach reduces unnecessary comparisons by intelligently moving back in the pattern

The key strength of this algorithm is its ability to efficiently handle pattern matching by avoiding redundant comparisons through the LPS array computation.

The code remains the same, and the core logic is correct. The main correction is in understanding how the LPS array is constructed, especially for strings with repetitive patterns.
